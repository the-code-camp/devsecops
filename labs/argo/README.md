# GitOps with ArgoCD

GitOps turns the CI/CD approach on its head - instead of an external automation server pushing changes into the cluster, a tool inside the cluster monitors a Git repo and pulls in any changes.

It means your cluster can be secured more cleanly, because you don't need a cluster admin user for the automation server. It also means your app definitions - and even the infrastructure setup for cloud services - can be definitively stored in Git repos. You can recreate your whole deployment from scratch.

## Install ArgoCD

ArgoCD has a server-side component which runs in the cluster and watches the configured Git repos for your projects. There's also a command line tool which you can use to set up and manage projects.

### Download Argo CD CLI

Start by installing the CLI - use the [full install docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/) or one of these quick options:

```
# Windows:
choco install argocd-cli

# Mac:
brew install argocd

# Linux:
sudo curl -sSL -o /usr/local/bin/argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/argocd
```

Check your installation with:

```
argocd version
```

> You'll see the client version and then a server error - the CLI can't connect to the ArgoCD server, because we haven't deployed it yet.

Here is the link to the Argo CD spec:

- [argocd specs yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml) - it installs a lot of resources, including CustomResourceDefinitions - CRDs - which extend the functionality of Kubernetes. ArgoCD adds an `Application` resource to the cluster.

### Deploy the Argo CD server components:

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Argo installs a new custom object type called _Application_.

ðŸ“‹ List all of the application objects in the cluster.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Custom objects can be used in Kubectl like ordinary objects:

```
kubectl get all -n argocd
```

</details><br/>

### Access The Argo CD API Server

By default, the Argo CD API server is not exposed with an external IP. To access the API server, use the below command to expose the server:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

The API server can then be accessed using https://localhost:8080

### Login Using The CLI
The initial password for the `admin` account is auto-generated and stored as clear text in the field `password` in a secret named `argocd-initial-admin-secret` in your Argo CD installation namespace. You can simply retrieve this password using the `argocd` CLI:

```sh
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```

Using the username `admin` and the `password` from above, login to Argo CD's IP or hostname:

```sh
argocd login localhost:8080 
```

Open the UI at http://localhost:8080, log in with username `admin` and the password from your Secret.

> You'll be redirected to HTTPS with a self-signed certificate, so you'll need to accept the security warning in your browser.

Open https://localhost:8080/settings/clusters - ArgoCD is registered with the local cluster so it can manage applications, but there are no apps yet.

## Configure the Git server

ArgoCD deploys apps as units which are configured with a source code repo to watch. The contents of the repo can be standard Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts or Kustomize. 

ArgoCD monitors the repo, and whenever there is a change - so the running app is out of sync with the specifications in the source repo - it fetches the changes and updates the app.

We'll run a local Git server to make the deployment simple:

- [gogs/gogs.yaml](./specs/gogs/gogs.yaml) is the same Gogs server we've used before, but configured to run in Kubernetes 

Deploy the Git server:

```sh
kubectl apply -f labs/argo/specs/gogs

# get the url for gogs server
minikube -n infra service gogs --url
```

Browse to http://192.168.49.2:30300/ and when the site is ready, sign in with username `courselabs` and password `student`.

Add the new Git server as a remote for this repo and push a copy of the content:

```
# add the local Git server:
git remote add labs-argo http://192.168.49.2:30300/courselabs/labs.git

# push to the expected branch name:
git push labs-argo main:master
```

> This version of ArgoCD expects to find a branch named `master` in the Git repo. This repo uses `main` as the branch name, so the push command uses the expected name in the Git server.

Now connect the ArgoCD CLI to the ArgoCD server, **using your password from the Secret**:

```
argocd cluster list
```

> You can add new clusters to deploy to a remote Kubernetes cluster. Apps can be managed with the CLI or with the UI.

## Deploy an application

Create an application for the app in the `labs/argo/project/whoami` folder - that folder contains a simple whoami app spec:

```
argocd app create whoami --repo http://gogs.infra.svc.cluster.local:3000/courselabs/labs.git --path labs/argo/project/whoami --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace default --sync-policy auto --self-heal
```

> Creating the app stores the definition in Kubernetes, and we've set the sync policy to _auto_ - so it will be deployed straight away.

You can also create apps by deploying Kubernetes YAML. Here's an alternative version of the [whoami application](./specs/apps/whoami.yaml) we could use.

ðŸ“‹ Check the details of the new application with the Argo CLI.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Applications are just Kubernetes objects - you can query them with Kubectl. But you get the key information in a readable format from the Argo CLI:

```
argocd app list

argocd app get whoami
```

</details><br/>


You can also see the new application in the UI at https://localhost:8080/applications. You'll see the status is _Synced_ and if you open the app you'll see all the Kubernetes resources.

ArgoCD deploys the app from the YAML specs in the repo - with no pipeline or scripts to maintain. You can test the app at http://192.168.49.2:30010/.


## Lab

Now let's see GitOps in action, making a change to the Docker image tag for the app, so it triggers a rollout with new Pods.

Edit the Kubernetes [deployment.yaml](./project/whoami/deployment.yaml) file and make two changes:

- set the image tag to `courselabs/whoami-lab:21.09-4`
- set the replica count to 3

Trigger the update by pushing your changes to the local Git server.

This ArgoCD application is set to self-heal, which means if an administrator removes any resources, ArgoCD will recreate them. Confirm that by deleting the Kubernetes Deployment object.

## Cleanup

Deleting apps in ArgoCD doesn't remove the running application - unless you use the cascade flag:

```
argocd app delete lab whoami --cascade
```

> ArgoCD asks you to confirm you really want to do this :)

Then delete the lab namespaces, which will remove ArgoCD and Gogs:

```
kubectl delete ns -l kubernetes.courselabs.co=argo
```

And remove the Git remote:

```
git remote rm labs-argo
```
