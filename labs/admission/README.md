# Controlling Admission

Admission control is the process of allowing - or blocking - workloads from running in the cluster. You can use this to enforce your own rules. You might want to block all containers unless they're using an image from an approved registry, or block Pods which don't include resource limits in the spec.

You can do this with admission controller webhooks - HTTP servers which run inside the cluster and get invoked by the API to apply rules when objects are created. Admission controllers can use your own logic, or can use a standard tool like [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org).

## Reference

- [Using admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/)
- [OPA Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/)
- [Gatekeeper policy library](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library)


## Validating and Mutating Webhooks

You can write your own admission control logic in a REST API which you run in the cluster, and configure rules which apply to Kubernetes objects:

- [this ValidatingWebhookConfiguration](./specs/validating-webhook/validatingWebhookConfiguration.yaml) fires when Pods are created or updated in the cluster, and calls the validate method on a custom webhook server; the server will return whether the action is allowed to proceed

- [this MutatingWebhookConfiguration](./specs/mutating-webhook/mutatingWebhookConfiguration.yaml) - fires when Pods are created or updated, and calls the mutate endpoint on the server; this could edit the spec and send back the changes before Kubernetes runs the action.

We could run a webhook server in the cluster - these examples work with a demo NodeJS web app ([source code on GitHub](https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol/tree/master/ch16/docker-images/admission-webhook/src)) - but there's a more common alternative.

## Run OPA Gatekeeper

Custom webhooks have two drawbacks: you need to write the code yourself, which adds to your maintenance estate; and their rules are not discoverable through the cluster, so you'll need external documentation.

OPA Gatekeeper is an alternative which implements admission control using generic rule descriptions (in a language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/)).

We'll deploy admission rules with Gatekeeper - which is another CNCF project. It extends Kubernetes with new object types, and you use those objects to store and apply your own rules.

OPA Gatekeeper is another complex component, where you trade the overhead of managing it with the issues of running your own controllers:

- [opa-gatekeeper/3.5.yaml](./specs/opa-gatekeeper/3.5.yaml) - deploys custom resources to describe admission rules, RBAC for the controller and a Service and Deployment to run it

_Deploy OPA:_

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/opa-gatekeeper
```

ðŸ“‹ What custom resource types does Gatekeeper install?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

Check the CustomResourceDefinitions:

```
kubectl get crd
```

You'll see a few - the main one we work with is the ConstraintTemplate.

</details><br/>

## Deploy OPA admission rules

There are two parts to applying rules with Gatekeeper:

1. Create a _ConstraintTemplate_ which defines a generic constraint (e.g. containers in a certain namespace can only use a certain image registry)

2. Create a _Constraint_ from the template (e.g. containers in namespace `whoami` can only use images from `courselabs` repos on Docker Hub)

The rule definition is done with the Rego generic policy language:

- [requiredLabels-template.yaml](./specs/opa-gatekeeper/templates/requiredLabels-template.yaml) - defines a simple (!) template to require labels on an object

- [resourceLimits-template.yaml](./specs/opa-gatekeeper/templates/resourceLimits-template.yaml) - defines a more complex template requiring container objects to have resources set

Create the templates:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/opa-gatekeeper/templates
```

ðŸ“‹ Check the custom resources again; how do you think Gatekeeper stores constraints in Kubernetes?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

```  
kubectl get crd
```

You see new CRDs for the constraint templates:

```
policyresourcelimits.constraints.gatekeeper.sh

requiredlabels.constraints.gatekeeper.sh
```

Gatekeeper creates a CRD for each constraint template, so each constraint becomes a Kubernetes resource.

</details><br/>

Here are the constraints which use the templates:

- [requiredLabels.yaml](./specs/opa-gatekeeper/constraints/requiredLabels.yaml) - requires `app` and `version` labels on Pods, and a `kubernetes.courselabs.co` label on namespaces

- [resourceLimits.yaml](./specs/opa-gatekeeper/constraints/resourceLimits.yaml) - requires resources to be specified for any Pods in the `apod` namespace

Deploy the constraints:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/opa-gatekeeper/constraints
```

ðŸ“‹ Print the details of the required labels namespace constraint. Is it clear what it's enforcing?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

The constraint type is a CRD so you can list objects in the usual way:

```  
kubectl get requiredlabels

kubectl describe requiredlabels requiredlabels-ns
```

You'll see all the existing violations of the rule, and it should be clear what's required - the label on each namespace.

</details><br/>

Rego is not a straightforward language - but it is a generic way of defining policies. Trivy uses Rego for its [Kubernetes misconfiguration policy library](https://github.com/aquasecurity/appshield/tree/master/kubernetes).

## Verify the OPA rules

This application YAML in the `labs/admission/specs/pi` folder violates all the OPA rules for namespaces and Pods.

ðŸ“‹ Deploy the app. Does it run?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure?</summary>

Use Kubectl apply:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/pi
```

You'll see errors saying that the namespace can't be created because of a policy violation, and then the other objects can't be created because the namespace doesn't exist.

</details>

Some policy failures happen on the objects which you create with Kubectl - so you see clear validation errors like this.

The fix is in [fix-1/01-namespace.yaml](./specs/pi/fix-1/01-namespace.yaml) which adds the required label to the namespace. Deploy the fixed version and check the output:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/pi/fix-1
```

The output from Kubectl says all the objects are created. It should be listening at http://192.168.49.2:30031. Is it working? No... The Service has been created but there's no response from it.

ðŸ“‹ Can you debug to see what the problem is?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Start by describing the Service:

```
kubectl describe svc pi-np -n pi
```

You'll see there are no _Endpoints_ which means no Pods are enlisted as targets for the Service to route traffic.

Try listing all the Pods in the namespace:

```
kubectl get po -n pi
```

None. Hmm. How about Deployments and ReplicaSets?

```
kubectl get deploy,rs -n pi
```

They've been created but there are no Pods. Describe the ReplicaSet to see the problem:

```
kubectl describe rs -n pi
```

Now you'll see the error.

</details>

The OPA Gatekeeper policy blocks Pods from being created - there are two warning messages in the events which tell you why:

```
Error creating: admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [resource-limits] container <pi-web> has no resource limits

Error creating: admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [requiredlabels-pods] you must provide labels: {"version"}
```

But you don't see that in Kubectl, because you're not creating Pods directly - you create a Deployment, which creates a ReplicaSet which creates the Pods.

The Pod template in [fix-2/deployment.yaml](./specs/pi/fix-2/deployment.yaml) adds the necessary labels and resources.

ðŸ“‹ Deploy the fix-2 YAML - does the app work now?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/pi/fix-2

kubectl get pods -n pi
```

Looking good :)

</details>

Try the app now at http://192.168.49.2:30031. It's running with a constrained amount of CPU and memory, and from an ops perspective it's easy to manage because it has a consistent set of labels.

## Lab

Your turn to try deploying an app and making sure it meets the admission requirements.

Try deploying the demo Astronomy Picture of the Day app from the specs for this lab:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/admission/specs/apod
```

It will fail because the resources don't meet the constraints we have in place. Your job is to fix up the specs and get the app running - without making any changes to policies :)

## Cleanup

Remove all the lab's namespaces, which removes all the other objects:

```
kubectl delete ns -l kubernetes.courselabs.co=admission
```

Except the CRDs:

```
kubectl delete crd -l gatekeeper.sh/system

kubectl delete crd -l gatekeeper.sh/constraint
```
