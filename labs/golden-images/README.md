# Golden Image Libraries

Docker Hub is a great place to find open-source software, pre-packaged and ready to run. But anyone can push public images to Docker Hub so you can't necessarily trust what you find there. Official images can be trusted, but they're updated frequently and you need to keep on top of the updates.

Letting developers use any base image for their apps is not a good idea. They could unkowingly use a malicious image which has a backdoor opened, or is running a bitcoin miner. Requiring official images to be the base is a better policy, but you could end up with lots of versions and variations which costs efficiency and make it harder to secure your apps. 

Building your own set of base images - _golden images_ - and mandating that all apps need to use those is the best approach. It lets you curate your own approved list of images and tailor them as you need.

## Developer Free-For-All

Let's understand the problem first. These two Java apps use different base images and different build patterns:

- [app-1/Dockerfile](./apps/app-1/Dockerfile) - uses the deprecated `java` image, and it's the JDK version used for compiling and running the app

- [app-2/Dockerfile](./apps/app-2/Dockerfile) - uses OpenJDK 11, with a multi-stage build with the JDK for compilation and the JRE at runtime; these are  Debian-based images

Build both apps with Compose:

```
docker compose -f labs/golden-images/apps/docker-compose.yml build
```

ðŸ“‹ List out the new images and compare them. Inspect the layers - are the two Java apps making good use of the layer cache?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

The image references both start with `courselabs/app` and use the `v1` tag so you can use that in a filter:

```
docker image ls "courselabs/app*:v1"
```

You'll see that app-2 is about a 200MB image and app-1 is over 600MB.

Inspec the images to check the layer IDs:

```
docker inspect courselabs/app-1:v1
```

You'll find around 12 layers in app-1.

```
docker inspect courselabs/app-2:v1
```

About half as many layers in app-2 - but there are no common layers with app-1.

</details>

These are both Java apps and need the same runtime, but their image hierarchies are completely divergent. There are no shared layers, so there's no re-use of the Docker layer cache - bad news for disk space and network bandwidth, even without considering the security of the images.

## A Golden Image Library

To build your own base library, you need to decide on the platforms and variants you want to support. You need to get a balance: you want a small number of golden images to keep it manageable and make best use of the cache, but you need to support your applications.

This library has two sets of images for Java apps:

- [JDK based on Debian](./library/java/debian/jdk/Dockerfile) and [JRE based on Debian](./library/java/debian/jre/Dockerfile). These use the slim OS versions, and they're pinned to a specific OpenJDK release - but not to a specific OS release because the official image doesn't provide that level of granularity

- [JDK based on Alpine](./library/java/alpine/jdk/Dockerfile) and [JRE based on Alpine](./library/java/alpine/jre/Dockerfile). These have a fully-versioned deployment - based on an explicit version of Alpine with an explicit version of OpenJDK. The versions are set in build arguments so it's easy to bump them when there's a new release

- [library/docker-compose.yml](./library/docker-compose.yml) - has the build details for the library images and uses a custom naming convention

ðŸ“‹ Build the image library with Compose, making sure you download the latest versions of the images in the `FROM` lines.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
docker compose -f ./labs/golden-images/library/docker-compose.yml build --pull
```

</details>

Check the sizes and tags of the new library images:

```
docker image ls "courselabs/java*"
```

The Alpine versions are about 2/3 the size of the Debian variants:

```
REPOSITORY        TAG                IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
courselabs/java   jdk-21.12          dbe839e1d807   About a minute ago   271MB       
courselabs/java   jre-21.12          ad98b2279e7f   About a minute ago   184MB       
courselabs/java   jre-debian-21.12   79786bc38074   2 weeks ago          221MB       
courselabs/java   jdk-debian-21.12   0d6d8cde8cc0   2 weeks ago          422MB
```

Now we have a set of images we can mandate for Java applications - with Alpine being preferred, but Debian available for additional compatibility.

## Using Golden Images

Using the image library just means changing the `FROM` image in the application Dockerfiles, and while we're doing that we can fix them up to use the standard multi-stage build pattern:

- [app-1/Dockerfile.v2](./apps/app-1/Dockerfile.v2) and [app-2/Dockerfile.v2](./apps/app-2/Dockerfile.v2) - both use the library JDK and JRE images

- [apps/docker-compose-v2.yml](./apps/docker-compose-v2.yml) - builds the apps with the v2 Dockerfiles and a `v2` tag

Build the new versions:

```
docker compose -f labs/golden-images/apps/docker-compose-v2.yml build
```


ðŸ“‹ List out the v2 images and compare the layers. Are we using the cache now?

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

These images start with `courselabs/app` and use the `v2` tag so you can use that in a filter:

```
docker image ls "courselabs/app*:v2"
```

They're both under 200MB - almost the same size as the golden JRE image. The application binaries are so small they don't add much to the base image.

Inspec the base image and application images to check the layer IDs:

```
docker inspect courselabs/java:jre-21.12

docker inspect courselabs/app-1:v2

docker inspect courselabs/app-2:v2
```

There are two layers in the JRE image - the Alpine layer plus the OpenJDK layer. The app-1 image reuses those layers and adds two more - one which creates the `/app` folder and one which adds the class file. The app-2 image also has four layers - sharing three with app-1, so only the final layer with the app binary is different.

</details>

On my system the original v1 app images use 864MB of disk space (221MB+643MB), because they don't share any layers. The v2 apps use 184MB between them, which is the JRE image they both share.

> You can use a tool like [Anchore](https://anchore.com) in your build to check the base images in your Dockerfiles, so builds will fail if the base images are not from the library

## Image Cache

It's tricky to see how much space your images actually use because Docker reports the _virtual size_ - which is how much storage the image would need if it was the only image on your machine. 

The output of the image list doesn't make it clear how much layer sharing is happening:

```
docker image ls "courselabs/app*"
```

It seems you have 2x184MB for the v2 apps, but we know that it's mostly one set of shared layers.

The `docker system` commands let you see how much storage is really being used, and let you clear down unused data.

ðŸ“‹ Use system commands to see how much disk space your images are using, and to clean up the unused data.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Disk usage uses the same command as the Linux OS:

```
docker system df
```

You'll see how many images are stored, how much disk they're using, and how much can be reclaimed. _Reclaimable_ images are ones which aren't being used by any containers - you don't really want to remove all of those, because it means next time you run a container you'll need to pull the image again.

But you can safely prune unused space, which deletes any layers which are no longer referenced by images (these are called _dangling_):

```
docker system prune -f
```

</details>

You'll want to regularly prune your system if you build lots of images. A scheduled job to prune any build servers is a good idea too - you'll be surprised how quickly an active server can max out the disk with Docker image layers.

## Lab

We have another Java app which should use our golden image, and it has a couple of other issues:

- [app-3/Dockerfile](./apps/app-3/Dockerfile) - the image uses Maven for the build; we don't have a golden image for that, but it isn't used in the final app image, so that can stay as it is. The runtime image is yet another `openjdk` variant.

- [app-3/pom.xml](./apps/app-3/pom.xml) - in Maven the POM file lists out all of the dependencies the application uses. But the current setup doesn't explicitly use the latest versions of the libraries so you we don't have a full audit trail.

The setup will give you a working image, but you can't tell from SCM which versions of the libraries are installed:

```
docker build -t app-3:v1 labs/golden-images/apps/app-3
```

Your goal is to fix up those files to use the golden JRE image for the runtime, and use the latest versions of the libraries - micrometer and the JAR plugin.

## Cleanup

Cleanup by removing all containers:

```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
